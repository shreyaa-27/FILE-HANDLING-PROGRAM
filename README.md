Description of the Program: File Handling in C
This C program demonstrates basic file handling operations, including writing, reading, and appending to a file. The user is prompted to enter a filename, and then they can choose from multiple options:

Write to the file: This option overwrites the file with new content.
Read from the file: This option displays the current content of the file.
Append to the file: This option adds new content at the end of the file.
Exit: This option terminates the program.
The program uses standard input-output functions and file-handling techniques to manage file operations efficiently.

Libraries Used in the Program
#include <stdio.h>

The Standard Input-Output Library in C is used for handling input and output operations.
It provides functions such as printf(), scanf(), fgets(), fputs(), fopen(), and fclose(), which are essential for file manipulation.
#include <stdlib.h>

The Standard Library in C provides general-purpose functions, including memory management, random number generation, and program control.
Although this program does not explicitly use functions from <stdlib.h>, it is included for good practice in case future modifications require functions like exit() or malloc().
Key Features of the Program
Basic File Handling: Demonstrates reading, writing, and appending operations.
Menu-Driven Interface: Allows the user to select options interactively.
Error Handling: Prevents reading from a non-existent file.
Efficient Memory Management: Ensures files are properly closed after use.
User-Friendly Input Handling: Uses fgets() to avoid buffer overflow issues.

Possible Enhancements
Multiple Lines Input: Modify the writing and appending modes to accept multiple lines of input until a special termination character (e.g., EOF) is entered.
Error Messages: Improve error handling with custom messages for different scenarios.
Binary File Handling: Extend the program to handle binary files using fwrite() and fread().
Conclusion
This program provides a simple yet effective way to handle text files using C. It utilizes essential file handling functions like fopen(), fgets(), fputs(), and fclose(), demonstrating how files can be written, read, and appended efficiently. Understanding this program is a crucial step toward mastering file handling in C, a fundamental concept in real-world applications like data logging, report generation, and configuration file management.
